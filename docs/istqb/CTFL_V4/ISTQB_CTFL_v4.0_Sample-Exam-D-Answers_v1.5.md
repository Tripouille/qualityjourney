Points
1 d a) Is not correct. Finding and fixing defects in the test object is not a typical
test objective as although identifying defects is an objective of testing,
fixing defects is not a test activity
b) Is not correct. Maintaining effective communications with developers is
not a typical test objective although it is useful in achieving other
objectives of testing, such as providing stakeholders with information
that enables them to make informed decisions. It is not a primary reason
for performing testing
c) Is not correct. Validating that legal requirements have been met is not a
typical test objective because validation is concerned with checking
whether the system meets users’ and other stakeholders’ needs in its
operational environment. Checking that legal requirements have been
met is a form of verification
d) Is correct. Building confidence in the quality of the test object is
achieved by executing tests that passed
FL-1.1.1 K1 1
2 c a) Is not correct. The miscalculation of bonuses is a failure by the system,
not a defect
b) Is not correct. The system not suitably supporting disabled users is a
failure which eventually results in a fine, but the fine itself is not a failure
(it appears to be the correct functioning of the regulatory system)
c) Is correct. The error is made by the programmer and this mistake is
caused by them working under severe time pressure, which is the root
cause of the subsequent defect
d) Is not correct. The poor design of the user interface, which does not
suitably address disabled users, is a design defect caused by the
designer error. Thus the design of the user interface includes a design
defect not a designer error

Points
3 a a) Is correct. The ‘tests wear out’ principle is concerned with the idea that
repeating identical tests on unaltered code is unlikely to uncover novel
defects and therefore, modifying tests may be essential. By using test
conditions to generate new tests each time, the tests will not be identical
and the risk of the tests wearing out is reduced
b) Is not correct. The ‘absence-of-defects fallacy’ principle is concerned
with ensuring that users’ needs are fulfilled even if lots of testing is done
and no defects are found (i.e., validation is also necessary). The use of
test conditions to generate test cases and execute tests does not
directly address this concern
c) Is not correct. The ‘early testing saves time and money’ principle is
concerned with fixing defects early on to prevent the occurrence of
subsequent defects in derived work products, thereby reducing costs
and the likelihood of failures. This is typically addressed by starting
testing (both static and dynamic) as early as possible, but this is not
addressed by using test conditions to generate test cases and execute
tests
d) Is not correct. The ‘Defects cluster together’ principle is concerned with
the distribution of defects in a system, which typically follows a Pareto
distribution. The use of test conditions to generate test cases and
execute tests does not address this concern, which is typically
addressed by risk-based testing

4 b Considering each of the listed test activities and their tasks:
A. Test analysis - To identify the features that require testing, the
test basis is analyzed and defined as test conditions, which are
then prioritized along with related risks. During this test analysis,
defects in the test basis are typically uncovered, and the test
object's testability may also be assessed. (Task 4)
B. Test design - Involves using test conditions to create test cases
and other necessary testware, such as test data requirements
and test charters for exploratory testing. (Task 1)
C. Test implementation - Test procedures, such as manual and
automated test scripts, are created from test cases and may be
assembled into test suites. Test procedures are prioritized and
arranged in a test execution schedule. (Task 3)
D. Test completion - Occurs at project milestones, such as release,
end of iteration or end of test level. Testware is identified and
archived or handed to the appropriate teams for reuse, the test
environment is shut down, and the test activities are analyzed for
lessons learned and future improvements. (Task 2)
Thus:
a) Is not correct
b) Is correct. The CORRECT match is: 1B, 2D, 3C, 4A
c) Is not correct

5 a Considering each of the listed testware, and the test activity that produces
it:
i. The test completion report is an output of test completion
ii. Data held in a database used for inputs and expected results is
the test data - output of test implementation
iii. The list of elements needed to build the test environment is the
test environment requirements - output of test design
iv. Documented sequences of test cases in execution order are the
test procedures - output of test implementation
v. Test cases - output of test design
Test implementation produces the following outputs: test procedures (iv),
automated test scripts, test suites, test data (ii), test execution schedule,
and test environment elements such as stubs, drivers, simulators, and
service virtualizations.
Thus:
a) Is correct. Items ii and iv in the list are produced as a result of test
implementation
b) Is not correct
c) Is not correct
d) Is not correct

6 d a) Is not correct. The testing role is primarily responsible for the technical
and engineering aspects of testing, such as test analysis, test design,
test implementation, and test execution. Evaluating the test basis for
defects and the test object for testability are tasks performed as part of
test analysis, so it is likely they are tasks performed by the testing role
b) Is not correct. The testing role is primarily responsible for the technical
and engineering aspects of testing, such as test analysis, test design,
test implementation, and test execution. Defining the test environment
requirements is a task performed as part of test design, so it is likely to
be a task performed by the testing role
c) Is not correct. The testing role is primarily responsible for the technical
and engineering aspects of testing, such as test analysis, test design,
test implementation, and test execution. Assessing the testability of a
test object is a task performed as part of test analysis, so it is likely to be
a task performed by the testing role
d) Is correct. The test management role primarily involves activities related
to test planning, test monitoring and test control, and test completion.
Thus, creating the test completion report, which is the prime output from
the test completion, is likely to be a task performed by the test
management role

c) Is not correct. The whole team approach is about how the team works
together, with the aim of higher quality deliverables, but it does not
necessarily result in faster deployment to end users
d) Is not correct. When using the whole team approach, testers work with
business representatives to create acceptance tests. There is no
suggestion that the approach will reduce collaboration with external
business users

8 b Considering each of the listed benefits and drawbacks of the independence
of testing:
i. Ideally, we want close collaboration between testers and
developers, which is not increased by isolation. Thus, this is a
disadvantage
ii. Testers and developers have varied backgrounds, technical
viewpoints, and potential biases, allowing testers to usefully
challenge assumptions made by stakeholders during system
specification and implementation. Thus, this is an advantage
iii. The main disadvantage of independence of testing is that testers
may become isolated from the development team, leading to
communication problems, a lack of collaboration, and potentially
an adversarial relationship, with testers being blamed for delays
and bottlenecks in the release process. Thus, this is a
disadvantage
iv. One of the disadvantages of independence of testing is that
testers may become isolated from the development team, leading
to developers feeling less accountable for quality. Thus, this is a
disadvantage
v. The primary benefit of independence of testing is that testers are
more likely to identify different types of failures and defects
compared to developers, due to their varied backgrounds,
technical viewpoints, and potential biases, including cognitive bias
Thus:
a) Is not correct
b) Is correct. The list entries showing benefits are ii and v
c) Is not correct
d) Is not correct

Points
9 a a) Is correct. Each test level has specific and distinct test objectives as a
different form of test object (e.g., single component and complete
system) is tested at each test level and overlapping test objectives
would lead to unnecessary duplication
b) Is not correct. Test analysis and test design for a given test level should
start during the corresponding development phase to facilitate early
testing (e.g., acceptance test analysis and test design should begin
during requirements analysis). Test implementation will generally start
later, and test execution will start during the test level
c) Is not correct. Test design for a given test level should start during the
corresponding development phase to facilitate early testing, however
test design (e.g., test case generation) needs to be based on an agreed
test basis, not an early draft, otherwise significant test effort may be
wasted on creating test cases for a design that later changes
d) Is not correct. Quality control applies to all development activities,
meaning that every software development activity has a corresponding
test activity. However, the same symmetry does not apply to dynamic
testing and static testing. There are some static testing activities (e.g.,
static analysis) for which there is no obvious corresponding dynamic
testing activity
FL-2.1.2 K1 1
10 a a) Is correct. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a well-known
example of a test-first approach to development
b) Is not correct. Test Level Driven Development is not a correct example
of a test-first approach to development
c) Is not correct. Function-Driven Development is not a correct example of
a test-first approach to development
d) Is not correct. Performance-Driven Development is not a correct
example of a test-first approach to development

12 b a) Is not correct. The benefits of retrospectives include team bonding and
learning from sharing issues, and better collaboration between
developers and testers through reviewing and improving working
practices. Calling out individuals who a team member may feel did not
fully contribute to achieving quality as required by the whole team
approach will not contribute to this team bonding and collaboration
b) Is correct. During the retrospective, the group discusses what aspects of
the project were successful and should be retained, as well as areas
that could be improved, and how to do so
c) Is not correct. The benefits of retrospectives are based on increased
effectiveness and efficiency through process improvements; they are
not an opportunity to let off steam and criticize management and
customers. Also, the test results are recorded, usually in the test
completion report, so anything said in the meeting could be read by
other stakeholders
d) Is not correct. Retrospectives are meetings that are typically held at the
end of an iteration where team members will focus on discussing
quality-related issues that have occurred in the current iteration. They
are not used for making plans or technical decisions for the next
iteration; this would be done in the iteration planning meeting at the start
of the next iteration

functional requirement to complete within one second is part of testing
its performance efficiency, which is part of non-functional testing
c) Is not correct. Evaluating the ease with which the sort function can be
modified from sorting ascending to sorting descending is testing its
modifiability, a form of non-functional maintainability testing, which is
part of non-functional testing
d) Is not correct. Assessing that the sort function still functions correctly

14 b a) Is not correct. Assuming that testers could check the ease of changing
the currency exchange system then it would be done by maintainability
testing rather than maintenance testing, so this is not a trigger for
maintenance testing
b) Is correct. A system modification (such as a fix or enhancement) is an
example of a trigger for maintenance testing. The removal of the refund
option of the currency exchange system was a fix that would lead to
maintenance testing
c) Is not correct. If the agile team has started developing a user story that
adds a new customer loyalty feature to the currency exchange system,
then this will result in them testing the new feature, and then they would
perform regression testing. No maintenance testing is required in this
situation
d) Is not correct. Reconfiguration of the currency exchange system to
support both the local language and English currency transactions is not
a system modification, a change to the operational environment, or a
system retirement, which are the three triggers for maintenance testing

c) Is correct. Most work products can be examined using some form of
static testing; however it is not suitable for work products that are too
complex for human interpretation and should not be analyzed by tools,
and encrypted code is too complex for humans and if it is properly
encrypted it will not be analyzable by most tools

19 b a) Is not correct. The document does not refer to the test object’s internal
structure but specifies the desired behavior of the test object. Therefore,
white-box test techniques will not be helpful in designing test cases
b) Is correct. The document is a requirement that specifies the desired
behavior of the test object. Therefore, the most suitable test techniques
in this case are the black-box test techniques (e.g., Boundary Value
Analysis or Decision Table Testing)
c) Is not correct. Although experience-based test techniques can be used
to design test cases based on this document, black-box test techniques
will be more suitable. The document describes a precise business rule
and, in addition, wording like "exceeds $100" suggests the existence of
important equivalence partition boundaries that should be tested using
black-box test techniques like Boundary Value Analysis
d) Is not correct. Risk-based test techniques are not a recognized type of

b) Is correct. CY – BY = 65, so these inputs correspond to a partition that
is not yet covered (“pensioner discount”)
c) Is not correct. CY – BY = –65, so these inputs correspond to the already
covered “error message” partition
d) Is not correct. CY – BY = 18, so these inputs correspond to the already

22 a Test cases TC1, TC2, TC3 and TC4 cover, respectively, rules R2, R3, R7
and R6 in the decision table.
a) Is correct. The conditions “66-year-old”, “unregistered” and “no
experience” match rule R4, which is not covered by the existing test
cases, so after adding this test case, the decision table coverage will
increase
b) Is not correct. The conditions “55-year-old”, “unregistered” and “2 years
of experience” match rule R2, already covered by TC1. So adding this
test case will not increase the coverage
c) Is not correct. The conditions “19-year-old”, “registered” and “5 years of

case will not increase the coverage
d) Is not correct. The existing test cases cover only 4 out of 7 columns of

transition between S1 and S3). This test case covers 4 out of 7 valid
transitions
b) Is correct. This sequence of five events covers 5 different transitions
(the first “Available” event corresponds to a transition between S1 and
S2, and the second “Available” event corresponds to a transition
between S3 and S2, so two different transitions are covered). This test
case covers 5 out of 7 valid transitions and achieves the highest valid
transitions coverage
c) Is not correct. This sequence of five events covers 3 different transitions
(both “Available” events correspond to the same transition from S1 to
S2; both “ChangeRoom” events correspond to the same transition from
S2 to S1). This test case covers 3 out of 7 valid transitions
d) Is not correct. This sequence of five events does not represent a
feasible test case, because after “Cancel” the system ends up in the

24 c a) Is not correct. A statement with a defect, when executed, does not have
to cause a failure. For example, a statement x := y / z will cause a failure
only when z equals 0
b) Is not correct. 100% statement coverage does not guarantee 100%
branch coverage. For example, a test case with x=0 for the code
1. IF (x=0) THEN
2. A;
3. ENDIF
achieves 100% statement coverage but does not cover the branch from
1 to 3
c) Is correct. 100% statement coverage means that each executable
statement was executed at least once
d) Is not correct. The removed test case may provide coverage of some
statements that are not covered by either of the other two test cases, in
which case the remaining two test cases together will not achieve 100%

25 a a) Is correct. A fundamental strength that all white-box test techniques
share is that the entire software implementation is taken into account
during testing, which facilitates defect detection even when the software
specification is vague, outdated or incomplete. This means white-box
testing can find defects such as an extra feature added to the code
(either accidentally or deliberately) that is not supposed to be there,
which black-box testing cannot detect
b) Is not correct. The fact that the coverage can be precisely defined is not
the right reason. The achieved level of coverage would have much more
impact than the possibility to measure the coverage
c) Is not correct. If the software does not implement one or more
requirements, white-box testing is unlikely to detect the resulting defects
of omission
d) Is not correct. While this is true, this is not the right answer, because
there is no connection between the capability to be used in both static
testing and dynamic testing and the claim that white-box testing
facilitates defect detection with poor specifications

a) Is not correct. This is an example of anticipating the developer’s error
b) Is not correct. This is an example of anticipating the defect
c) Is correct. This is an example of a potential root cause of a defect,
which is neither an error, defect nor failure, and difficult for the tester to
anticipate
d) Is not correct. This is an example of anticipating a failure, perhaps
based on experience of previous systems in this application domain

27 d a) Is not correct. In exploratory testing, test cases are usually created
during the exploratory testing session, alongside test analysis, test
implementation and test execution
b) Is not correct. In exploratory testing, tests are simultaneously designed,
executed, and evaluated while the tester learns about the test object
c) Is not correct. Exploratory test results depend heavily on the tester’s
experience. So, even if the test results of exploratory testing can be
used as a predictor of risk and used to assess whether there will be
fewer or more defects, compared to the previous exploratory testing
session, they are not a good example of reliable defect prediction
models that can predict the number of remaining defects
d) Is correct. During exploratory testing, the testers can use any test
techniques that they find useful

31 a Using the three-point estimation technique, the final estimate (E) is
calculated as:
E = (a + 4*m + b) / 6,
where a is the most optimistic estimate, m is the most likely estimate, and b
is the most pessimistic estimate.
Thus:
a) Is correct. In this case, the estimate for executing a single test case is:
E = (1h + 4*3h + 8h) / 6 = 3.5 hours
So, the total time needed for the tester to execute 4 test cases is:
3.5h * 4 = 14 hours
b) Is not correct
c) Is not correct
d) Is not correct

32 b TC1 achieves the highest coverage (4/7 – Req1, Req3, Req4 and Req7), so
should be executed first.
Req2, Req5 and Req6 are still not covered.
The next test case that achieves the highest additional coverage of the
remaining requirements is TC3, covering 2 out of these 3 requirements
(Req5 and Req6). So, TC3 should be executed as the second one.
Now the only requirement still not covered is Req2, which is covered by
TC4. Therefore, TC4 should be executed as the third test case.
So, the last test case executed will be TC2.
Thus:
a) Is not correct
b) Is correct
c) Is not correct
d) Is not correct

34 b Risk assessment can use a quantitative or qualitative approach, or a mix of
them. In the quantitative approach the risk level is calculated as the
multiplication of risk likelihood and risk impact. So, Risk level = Risk
likelihood * Risk impact
Then, Risk impact = Risk level / Risk likelihood.
In our case, Risk impact = $1,000 / 50% = $1,000 / 0.5 = $2,000.

37 d a) Is not correct. Risk management consists of risk analysis and risk
control. Neither of these activities supports the reassembly of the files
that made up the release, because these activities deal with risks, not
with configuration items
b) Is not correct. Test monitoring is concerned with gathering information
about testing. This information is used to assess test progress and to
measure whether the exit criteria or the test tasks associated with the
exit criteria are satisfied, such as meeting the targets for coverage of
product risks, requirements, or other acceptance criteria. Test control
uses the information from test monitoring to provide, in the form of
control directives, guidance and the necessary corrective actions to
achieve the most effective and efficient testing. None of these activities
deal with the management of configuration items
c) Is not correct. The whole team approach builds on the tester’s skill to
work effectively in a team context and to contribute positively to the
team goals. So, it focuses on team-related issues, not on configuration
items
d) Is correct. Configuration management provides a discipline for
identifying, controlling, and tracking work products. Configuration
management keeps a record of changed configuration items when a
new baseline is created. Using configuration management, it is possible
to revert to a previous baseline in order to reproduce previous test
results

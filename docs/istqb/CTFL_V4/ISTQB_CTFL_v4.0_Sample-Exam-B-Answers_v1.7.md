Points
1 d a) Is not correct. It is often possible to use dynamic testing to cause a test
object to fail in ways that could never be achieved by the users, such as
by using fault injection. However, if the failure can never occur with real
end users, then identifying it is not especially valuable as testing is
ultimately aimed at improving the work product for the end users.
Spending time testing for failures that cannot occur with real users is not
an efficient use of a tester’s time
b) Is not correct. Static testing in the form of static analysis is used by
developers to identify defects in their code earlier than can be achieved
through dynamic testing. Note, however, that static testing (and static
analysis) is used to detect defects, not failures, which are found by
dynamic testing. Thus it is the use of the term ‘failures’ that makes this
an incorrect option
c) Is not correct. Static analysis directly detects defects in code, and this is
normally information for the developer, not the customer.
d) Is correct. Reviews are a form of static testing that can be applied from
the very start of the software development lifecycle and are used to find
defects that can be removed before subsequent development activities
waste effort on faulty requirements. If the defects are not detected and
removed early on, then when the defect is found in derived work
products, such as the design and code, the requirements will need to be
changed.

2 b a) Is not correct. QA concentrates on process improvement and
implementation, using a preventive approach to avoid errors and
defects, while testing is a form of QC that is used to detect defects
b) Is correct. QC aims to achieve appropriate levels of quality by focusing
on identifying and correcting product defects. Testing is a significant
part of QC and helps to uncover these defects
c) Is not correct. Although testing is a significant part of QC and helps to
uncover defects, other (non-testing) techniques utilized in QC include
formal methods like model checking and proof of correctness, as well as
simulation and prototyping

3 d The ‘exhaustive testing is impossible’ principle is concerned with the fact
that it is not feasible to test every possible variation of inputs in all different
circumstances, except in trivial cases. Instead, testing utilizes test
techniques, test case prioritization, and risk-based testing to sample from
the set of possibilities and focus test efforts.
a) Is not correct. The principle states that it is not feasible to test everything
except in trivial cases. Testing everything would require testing every
possible variation of inputs in all different circumstances, which is
generally infeasible as there will be a practically infinite number of
possibilities. Testing every possible expected result will not address this
problem as the relationship between inputs and expected results can be
different for each test object. Sometimes there may be a practically
infinite number of possible expected results (e.g., when there are
several variables representing real numbers), whereas at other times
there may be just two expected results, such as with a single variable
that can be either true or false
b) Is not correct. The principle states that it is not feasible to test every
possible variation of inputs in all different circumstances. This is
because for non-trivial systems there is a practically infinite number.
Therefore, in practice, documenting all possible input variations would
be impractical as it would take an infinite length of time
c) Is not correct. Starting testing as early as possible with reviews and
other static testing approaches will not address the problem of there
being too many possible test cases. The ‘early testing saves time and
money’ principle is concerned with fixing defects early on to prevent the
occurrence of subsequent defects in derived work products, thereby
reducing costs and the likelihood of failures
d) Is correct. The use of equivalence partitioning and boundary value
analysis to generate test cases is one way to address the principle as
these test techniques provide a systematic way to derive a finite subset
of all possible test cases

4 a a) Is correct. Test design involves using test conditions to create test
cases and other necessary testware, such as test data requirements
and test charters for exploratory testing. Test environment requirements
are also specified, including the necessary infrastructure and tools
b) Is not correct. Test execution involves executing test cases (as part of
test procedures), however it does not directly cover the other testware
mentioned in the question, such as test data requirements, test
environment requirements and test conditions
c) Is not correct. Test analysis is used to identify the features that require
testing. The test basis is analyzed and defined as test conditions, which
are then prioritized along with related risks. While this activity involves
working with test conditions, it does not cover the other testware
mentioned in the question, such as test data requirements, test
environment requirements and test cases
d) Is not correct. Test implementation includes the generation of test
procedures, such as manual and automated test scripts, which are
created from test cases and may be assembled into test suites. Test
procedures are prioritized and arranged in a test execution schedule.
Test data is created, and the test environment built, and its set up
verified. While this activity involves explicitly working with test cases,
and may use test data requirements and test environment requirements
to create test data and the test environment, it does not cover test
conditions

Points
5 c a) Is not correct. The organization’s marketing team is unlikely to perform
much testing (although in some organizations they may be involved with
acceptance testing), so their average level of experience (most of which
would be in marketing) is not likely to impact how testing is performed
for a given test object
b) Is not correct. The level of knowledge of users that a new system is
being built for them is unlikely to affect how testing is performed. Any
user involvement that could affect how testing is performed is more
likely to be as a result of decisions made by the testers, customer and
project manager
c) Is correct. The number of years’ experience of the members of the
performance efficiency testing team will help to determine the
capabilities and knowledge (e.g., of different tools and defect types) that
the team members will apply when they are testing
d) Is not correct. The organizational structure of the different end users
(who may be varied) will change between users. So, it may not even be
known when the application is being tested, and the end user’s
organizational structure can thus have little effect on how the testing is
performed

6 b a) Is not correct. Traceability between the mitigated risks and test cases
that passed provides little information, because to be mitigated (by
testing) the risks would need to have a corresponding test case that
passed. To be able to assess residual risk, traceability between all risks
and test results needs to be available, so that the risks that do not have
a corresponding passing test can be identified as the residual risks
b) Is correct. Traceability between user requirements and test results
provides an indication of which user requirements have been tested and
so provides a means of measuring project progress (in the context of
testing) against business goals
c) Is not correct. It is not clear that test cases that failed provide an
indication of tester’s skills any more than test cases that passed. It
would partly depend on the test objective (e.g., building confidence or
causing failures). Also, such measurement of testers based on test
cases that passed and failed can be counter-productive as it could
cause the testers to optimize their testing based on that metric rather
than the test objective
d) Is not correct. Traceability between the identified risks and written test
conditions provides a means of determining which further test conditions
need to be written. Determining which risks are worth testing is part of
risk management, and risk mitigation in particular

7 b a) Is not correct. Strong communication skills, active listening, and
teamwork abilities enable a tester to interact effectively with all
stakeholders, however a deep knowledge of a variety of computer
games that allowed them to get on well with one developer is not an
example of a generic skill useful to testers
b) Is correct. Domain knowledge that can be used to understand and
communicate with end-users and business representatives is one of the
generic skills required by testers. A tester with experience as a pilot
would make them better able to appreciate the acceptance criteria for
the helicopter control system
c) Is not correct. Although programming skills could be considered as
technical knowledge which can increase efficiency when utilizing some
test tools, it is unlikely that these skills would improve their
communication with business analysts
d) Is not correct. Although thoroughness, attention to detail, curiosity, and
a methodical approach to identifying hard-to-find defects are all useful
generic skills for testers, it is doubtful they would be generating test
cases prior to starting exploratory testing. This is because one of the
main tenets of exploratory testing is that the test cases are generated
during the testing, not scripted in advance

8 d a) Is not correct. The whole-team approach allows any team member with
the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake any task, however that
does not mean that team members can take on any role at any time.
Typically, they only take on roles in which they are competent, and there
is no suggestion that every team member can do every role
b) Is not correct. The whole-team approach applies to how a single team
(typically in Agile software development) works; it does not cover how
multiple teams are supposed to work on larger projects, and it does not
suggest that only one ‘whole’ team is needed for a complete project
c) Is not correct. The whole-team approach does not expect every team
member to be involved in every important decision. For instance, there
is no need for the business representative (i.e., the Product Owner) to
be involved in every technical decision that does not affect the business
outcome and implementing such an approach would unnecessarily slow
down the team’s progress
d) Is correct. By leveraging the diverse skill sets of each team member
most effectively, the whole-team approach fosters superior team
dynamics, promotes robust communication and collaboration, and
generates a team synergy that benefits the entire project

9 b a) Is not correct. In agile software development, deliverables are produced
in each iteration, and the frequent delivery of increments necessitates
extensive regression testing. Although some (or all) of this regression
testing may be automated, the regression testing (automated or not)
cannot be replaced by automation of system tests
b) Is correct. If a sequential development model is used, then early in the
software development lifecycle no code is available for execution, and
so during this time static testing (e.g., reviews) is performed. Later in the
lifecycle, when code is available for execution, dynamic testing is
possible. Note, however, that preparation for dynamic testing will often
occur early in any software development lifecycle
c) Is not correct. If an iterative development model, like agile software
development, is used, then component tests may well be used for
regression testing for each iteration. In which case, there is a strong
argument for automating these component tests, which will have to be
run frequently, and there is unlikely to be a strong argument for
developers performing these component tests manually
d) Is not correct. In most incremental development models, deliverables
are produced in each increment, requiring both static testing and
dynamic testing at all test levels for each increment delivered

10 b a) Is not correct. Testers should review work products as soon as drafts
are available to enable early testing as part of a shift-left approach. If
they waited until the next development phase, then unnecessary
development (and test) work could be started on unreviewed, flawed
work products
b) Is correct. Testers should review work products as soon as drafts are
available to enable early testing as part of a shift-left approach
c) Is not correct. Testers typically review work products that form the test
basis as part of test analysis, not before test analysis and test design
d) Is not correct. Testers should review work products as soon as drafts
are available to enable early testing as part of the shift-left approach.
Waiting until they are published means that any defects that could be
found by tester’s review will be in the published document

12 b a) Is not correct. DevOps enhances testing in several ways, such as by
providing fast feedback on code quality, automated regression testing
that minimizes regression risk, and promoting a shift-left approach with
high-quality code submission and component tests. This is largely
provided through continuous integration, where the developers submit
component (unit) tests with their new code, which must pass for the
code to be admitted to the build. Therefore, developers do need to
complete component testing
b) Is correct. DevOps enhances testing in several ways, such as by
providing fast feedback on code quality, automated regression testing
that minimizes regression risk, and promoting a shift-left approach with
high-quality code submission and component tests
c) Is not correct. DevOps enhances testing in several ways, such as by
providing fast feedback on code quality, automated regression testing
that minimizes regression risk, and promoting a shift-left approach with
high-quality code submission and component tests. Testers do not
attempt to treat developers and operations equally by spending more
time on release testing, although a shift-right approach to testing
(testing in production) may well be used
d) Is not correct. Automated processes like continuous
integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) in DevOps facilitate stable test
environments and reduce the need for manual testing, however, there is
a risk of overlooking the importance of manual testing, especially from a
user's perspective

13 a a) Is correct. System testing examines the behavior and capabilities of the
complete system and covers non-functional testing of quality
characteristics, which includes security testing. This type of testing is
often performed by an independent test team based on system
specifications
b) Is not correct. System integration testing examines the interfaces with
other systems and external services
c) Is not correct. Beta testing is a type of acceptance testing performed at
an external site by roles outside the development organization
d) Is not correct. Component integration testing involves testing the
(interfaces and) interactions between components of a system, such as
the user interface and database
FL-2.2.1 K2 1
14 d a) Is not correct. Regression tests increase in number as the project
progresses, as new regression tests are typically required as changes
are made to the system. Similarly, the number of confirmation tests also
typically increases as the project progresses as new confirmation tests
are needed for each fix made to a system
b) Is not correct. It is the other way round. Confirmation tests are created
and run when the test object is fixed, and regression tests are (ideally)
run whenever the test object is enhanced (changed)
c) Is not correct. Confirmation testing verifies that a defect has been fixed
correctly and so is concerned with testing changes to the test object.
However, regression testing ensures that changes (including changes to
the operational environment) do not have negative effects on
unchanged software and so does not check that the operational
environment remains unchanged
d) Is correct. Regression testing ensures that changes do not have
negative effects on unchanged software. Confirmation testing verifies
that a defect has been fixed – and so is concerned with changed code

dynamically test the user interface and provide feedback on its usability
b) Is correct. A code review can detect code that cannot be reached by
any path, however dynamic tests can only exercise reachable code and
cannot determine that code cannot be reached without running every
possible combination of inputs and input states, which is impractical for
real code
c) Is not correct. Poor response times for most of the expected users are
difficult to determine without executing the code (i.e., by static testing),
so in this situation dynamic testing could find a defect, but static testing
is unlikely to find it
d) Is not correct. A review of the code by someone who is aware of the
required features could detect that the required features had not been
implemented in the code, and dynamic testing could also be used to
determine that these required features had not been implemented

16 c a) Is not correct. The feedback is from stakeholders (e.g., business
representatives and end users), not from developers, so this feedback is
not likely to inform managers which developers are more or less
productive
b) Is not correct. Early and frequent feedback from stakeholders is not
used by project managers to prioritize how they interact with the
different stakeholders
c) Is correct. Obtaining feedback from stakeholders early and often in the
software development process can be highly beneficial as it facilitates
early communication of potential quality issues, can prevent
misunderstandings about requirements, and ensures that any changes
in stakeholder requirements are understood and implemented sooner
d) Is not correct. Early and frequent feedback can prevent the
development of a product that does not meet stakeholder needs, and
results in costly rework and missed deadlines, so, ideally there should
be no delay. Also, the feedback is from stakeholders (not to them),
which includes the end users, so the end users providing feedback will
not aid the end users’ understanding

19 d a) Is not correct. Decision table testing is a black-box test technique, not a
white-box test technique – the test cases are not based on the decisions
in the source code. In branch testing, the test cases are derived from
knowledge of the control flow of the test object
b) Is not correct. Anticipation of potential defects is used in error guessing
(an experience-based test technique), not in branch testing (a white-box
test technique). In decision table testing, the test cases are derived from
the specification that describes the business logic
c) Is not correct. If a test case is based on the knowledge of the control
flow of the test object, it is a white-box test technique. Decision table
testing is typically based on an analysis of business logic, so it is a
black-box test technique. In branch testing, test cases are not derived
from the specification – this would make it a black-box test technique.
Branch testing is a white-box test technique, where test cases are
derived based on the source code structure
d) Is correct. Decision table testing is a black-box test technique, so it is
based on an analysis of the specified behavior of the test object without
reference to its internal structure. Therefore, the test cases are
independent of how the software is implemented. Branch testing is a
white-box test technique, so test cases are based on an analysis of the
test object’s internal structure and processing. As the test cases are
dependent on how the software is designed and coded, they can only
be created after the design or implementation of the test object

• passwords OK {6, 7, …, 11, 12}
• passwords too long {13, 14, …}
To achieve full coverage for 3-value BVA we need to test the following
values:
0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14.
Since 2-value BVA is already covered, this means that we have already
tested the passwords of length:
0, 5, 6, 12 and 13.
This means that the additional lengths that need to be covered to move

23 c
Let us refer to the transitions with E1, …, E5 as in the picture. The variable
N denotes the number of elements currently stored. Each “Add” event
increases it by 1, and each “Remove” event decreases it by 1. Notice, that
when the “Add” event occurs while being in the NOT FULL state, the state
changes to FULL only if N=2. If N<2, the system stays in the NOT FULL
state. If N=0, no “Remove” action is possible. Similarly, if N=3, no “Add”
action is possible.
Test a) can be written as E1, E3, E3, E2, E4 (so covers 4 out of 5
valid transitions, achieving 80% valid transitions coverage).
Test b) is infeasible, because after the first three “Add” actions the
system is in the FULL state and there is no valid transition going
from FULL triggered by the “Add” event. After the first three
transitions only 60% of valid transitions coverage is achieved.
Test c) can be written as E1, E2, E4, E5, E3 (so covers 5 out of 5
valid transitions, achieving 100% valid transitions coverage).
Test d) can be written as E1, E2, E4, E5, E4 (so covers 4 out of 5
valid transitions, achieving 80% valid transitions coverage).

24 b a) Is not correct. Coverage is always defined as the percentage of the
covered elements. Therefore, it cannot exceed 100%
b) Is correct. If the statements executed by T1 and T2 were disjoint, the
coverage of the test suite {T1, T2} would be 105%, which is impossible
(see answer a). Therefore, at least 5% of executable statements must
have been executed by both T1 and T2
c) Is not correct. Statement coverage does not tell us anything about the

25 c Branch testing is a white-box test technique in which the coverage items are
branches. A branch is a transfer of control between two nodes in the control
flow graph, which shows the possible sequences in which source code
statements are executed in the test object. Each transfer of control can be
either unconditional (i.e., straight-line code) or conditional (i.e., a decision
outcome). Coverage is measured as the number of branches exercised by
the test cases divided by the total number of branches, and is expressed as
a percentage.
Thus:
a) Is not correct. A decision outcome is a conditional branch. For branch
testing, X counts not only conditional, but also unconditional branches
b) Is not correct. Branch coverage counts not only conditional, but also
unconditional branches
c) Is correct. Branch coverage is measured as the number of branches
exercised by the test cases divided by the total number of branches,
and is expressed as a percentage
d) Is not correct. Both X and Y count only conditional branches and do not
take into account the unconditional branches

$90,000 (calculated from the four projects).
The average test-to-development effort ratio is 1:10 ($90,000 : $900,000),
which means that historically, on average, the test effort is 10% of the
development effort.
So if the development effort is estimated to be $800,000, the estimated test

32 b The logical dependencies mean that for each product you have to run
SEARCH → VIEW → ADD before running ORDER. You can add more
products (using the same flow), before you run ORDER.
Based on this, TC1 or TC2 must be executed first, otherwise no progress
can be made.
The first priority should be given to VIEW and ADD product B, as its test
cases (TC6, TC4) are assigned with higher priority.
So, the first 3 tests to execute are TC2 -> TC4 -> TC6
Now we need to consider whether to run TC7 and then the entire flow for
product A or run the TCs for product A first. If TC7 has lower priority than
the other tests, they should be tested first.
Therefore, the entire flow should be:
TC2 -> TC4 -> TC6 -> TC1 -> TC3 -> TC5 -> TC7

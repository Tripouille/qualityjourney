Introduction
Purpose of this document
The example questions and answers and associated justifications in this sample exam have been
created by a team of subject matter experts and experienced question writers with the aim of:
• Assisting ISTQB® Member Boards and Exam Boards in their question writing activities
• Providing training providers and exam candidates with examples of exam questions
These questions cannot be used as-is in any official examination.
Note, that real exams may include a wide variety of questions, and this sample exam is not
intended to include examples of all possible question types, styles or lengths, also this sample
exam may both be more difficult or less difficult than any official exam.
Instructions
In this document you may find:
• Questions1, including for each question:
- Any scenario needed by the question stem
- Point value
- Response (answer) option set
• Additional questions, including for each question [does not apply to all sample exams]:
- Any scenario needed by the question stem
- Point value
- Response (answer) option set
• Answers, including justification are contained in a separate document
1 In this sample exam the questions are sorted by the LO they target; this cannot be expected of a live exam.

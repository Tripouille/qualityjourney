Question #19 (1 Point)
Which of the following statements BEST describes the difference between decision table testing

Question #21 (1 Point)
You are testing a form that verifies the correctness of the length of the password given as input.
The form accepts a password with the correct length and rejects a password that is too short or too
long. The password length is correct if it has between 6 and 12 characters inclusive. Otherwise, it
is considered incorrect.
At first, the form is empty (password length = 0). You apply boundary value analysis to the
“password length” variable.
Your set of test cases achieves 100% 2-value boundary value coverage. The team decided that
due to the high risk of this component, test cases should be added to ensure 100% 3-value
boundary value coverage.
Which additional password lengths should be tested to achieve this?
a) 4, 5, 13, 14
b) 7, 11
c) 1, 5, 13
d) 1, 4, 7, 11, 14

Question #37 (1 Point)
Which of the following BEST describes an example of how configuration management (CM)
supports testing?
a) Having the version number of the environment, the CM tool can retrieve the version

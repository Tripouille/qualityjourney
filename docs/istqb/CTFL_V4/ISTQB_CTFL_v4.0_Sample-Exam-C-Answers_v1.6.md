1 b a) Is not correct. Validating that documented requirements are met is
incorrect as validation is concerned with meeting user requirements and
expectations, while verification is concerned with meeting specified
requirements, so this would be correct if we replaced ‘validating’ with
‘verifying’
b) Is correct. Causing failures and identifying defects is probably the most
common objective of dynamic testing
c) Is not correct. Initiating errors and identifying root causes is incorrect
because testers do not initiate errors, they try to cause failures. Errors
are typically made by developers (and cannot really be initiated) and
result in defects, which testers attempt to identify either directly through
static testing or indirectly through failures with dynamic testing.
Identifying root causes is useful but is part of debugging, which is a
separate activity from testing
d) Is not correct. Verifying the test object meets user expectations is
incorrect as verification is concerned with checking specified
(documented) requirements are met, while validation is concerned with
meeting user requirements and expectations, so this would be correct if
we replaced ‘verifying’ with ‘validating’

2 c a) Is not correct. Dynamic testing does cause failures (from which defects
can then be located and fixed). However, debugging is concerned with
locating defects and fixing these defects. Therefore, debugging does not
fix failures
b) Is not correct. Both testing and debugging contribute to improving the
quality of the test object, so both should be considered positively.
Debugging is generally considered to be a positive activity as it is fixing
something. Dynamic testing does involve intentionally causing the test
object to fail, which is why some people consider it a negative activity,
but that is a very narrow view (and not one typically held by testers).
Both positive and negative test cases are possible. Positive test cases
check that the test object correctly performs what it is supposed to do,
while negative testing checks that the test object does not do what it is
not supposed to do
c) Is correct. Testing determines that defects exist either directly through
observation of the defect in reviews (or by a tool in static analysis), or
indirectly by causing a failure in dynamic testing. Debugging is a
separate activity from testing (normally performed by developers) and is
concerned with locating defects (only for dynamic testing) and fixing the
defects
d) Is not correct. The causes of defects are typically human errors. Testing
finds defects either directly through static testing, or indirectly by
causing failures in dynamic testing, and debugging fixes defects. So,
testing does not find the cause of defects and debugging does not fix
the causes of defects

3 b The ‘absence-of-defects fallacy’ is concerned with the idea that ensuring
correctness in accordance with the requirements (i.e., verifying the absence
of implementation defects) does not guarantee user satisfaction with the
system. To address this it is also necessary to validate that the system
meets users' needs and expectations, fulfills business objectives, and
outperforms competing systems.
a) Is not correct. The ‘testing shows the presence, not the absence of
defects’ principle explains that while testing can detect the existence of
defects in the test object, it is not possible to demonstrate that there are
no defects and, therefore, guarantee its correctness. Therefore,
explaining that it is not possible for testing to show the absence of
defects would partially address this principle, not the ‘absence-of-
defects’ fallacy
b) Is correct. By supporting the end user to perform acceptance testing it
should be possible to validate that the system meets users' needs and
expectations
c) Is not correct. It is not possible to ensure that no implementation defects
remain in the delivered system as the ‘testing shows the presence, not
the absence of defects’ principle explains that while testing can detect
the existence of defects in the test object, it is not possible to
demonstrate that there are no defects and, therefore, guarantee its
correctness
d) Is not correct. Modifying tests that cause no failures to ensure few
defects remain is one way to address the ‘tests wear out’ principle. This
principle is concerned with the idea that repeating identical tests on
unaltered code is unlikely to uncover novel defects and therefore,
modifying tests may be essential. This will not validate that the system
meets users' needs and expectations

4 b, e Given the following description of test analysis:
To identify the features that require testing, the test basis is analyzed and
defined as test conditions, which are then prioritized along with related
risks. The systematic identification of test conditions as coverage items
often involves using test techniques both during test analysis and as part of
the test design activity.
From the above description, it can be seen that test techniques are often
used in the test analysis and test design activities. Boundary value analysis
and equivalence partitioning are test techniques.
a) Is not correct. Test implementation is not likely to involve the use of test
techniques as it is mostly concerned with assembling test cases into
test procedures, while test techniques create test cases
b) Is correct. Test design is likely to involve the use of test techniques to
create test cases from test conditions and coverage items
c) Is not correct. Test execution is not likely to involve the use of test
techniques as it is mostly concerned with executing test procedures
(and so test cases), while test techniques create test cases
d) Is not correct. Test monitoring is not likely to involve the use of test
techniques. Test monitoring is mostly concerned with ongoing checks to
ensure the plan is being followed, while test techniques create test
cases
e) Is correct. Test analysis is likely to involve the use of test techniques to
identify test conditions

5 a Considering each of the listed test activities and their output testware:
A. Test analysis - prioritized test conditions (4) (e.g., acceptance

B. Test design - prioritized test cases, test charters, coverage items
(1), test data requirements, and test environment requirements
C. Test implementation - test procedures, automated test scripts,
test suites, test data, test execution schedule (3), and test
environment elements such as stubs, drivers, simulators, and
service virtualizations
D. Test completion - test completion report, documented lessons
learned, action items for improvement, and change requests (2)

6 c a) Is not correct. Although it is correct to say that in Agile software
development, some of the test management tasks may be handled by
the Agile team itself, the testing role is not primarily the responsibility of
a single individual from outside the team. Instead the testing is more
likely to be performed by various team members following the whole-
team approach
b) Is not correct. The test management role primarily involves activities
related to test planning, test monitoring and test control, and test
completion. So, although this statement is partially correct, it is wrong to
say that the testing role is primarily responsible for test monitoring and
test control
c) Is correct. In Agile software development, some of the test management
tasks may be handled by the Agile team itself. However, for test
activities that span multiple teams within an organization, test managers
outside of the development team may perform these tasks
d) Is not correct. The test management role primarily involves activities
related to test planning, test monitoring and test control, and test
completion, while the testing role is primarily responsible for the
technical and engineering aspects of testing, such as test analysis, test
design, test implementation, and test execution. Thus the test
management role is not normally responsible for test analysis and test
design, although it is correct to say that the testing role is primarily
responsible for test implementation and test execution

7 b a) Is not correct. In the whole-team approach, testers play a vital role by
sharing their testing expertise with the team and guiding product
development. They collaborate with other team members to achieve the
desired quality levels and work with business representatives to create
acceptance tests. Testers also partner with developers to determine the
optimal test strategy and test automation approaches
b) Is correct. By leveraging the diverse skill sets of each team member
most effectively, the whole-team approach fosters superior team
dynamics, promotes robust communication and collaboration, and
generates a synergistic effect that benefits the entire project
c) Is not correct. The whole-team approach allows any team member with
the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake any task, thus specialist
team members are not an advantage of this approach
d) Is not correct. There is no specific guidance on the optimum size of
teams using the whole-team approach, and there is no suggestion that
larger teams are better

8 a a) Is correct. The primary benefit of independence of testing is that testers
are more likely to identify different types of failures and defects
compared to developers, due to their varied backgrounds, technical
viewpoints, and potential biases, including cognitive bias. However, the
main disadvantage of independence of testing is that testers may
become isolated from the development team, leading to communication
problems, a lack of collaboration, and potentially an adversarial
relationship, with testers being blamed for delays and bottlenecks in the
release process
b) Is not correct. A developer’s familiarity with the code does not mean that
they rarely find defects in it, instead this familiarity means they can
efficiently find many defects in their own code. And, rather than
developers and testers having a shared background, developers having
a different background to testers is normally cited as the reason that
testers and developers find different kinds of defects
c) Is not correct. Testing can be performed at different levels of
independence, ranging from no independence for the author to very
high independence for testers from outside the organization. In most
projects, multiple levels of independence are utilized, with developers
performing component testing and component integration testing, the
test team performing system testing and system integration testing, and
business representatives performing acceptance testing. So, testers can
be in the developer’s team and do not need to come from outside the
organization. Knowledge of the application domain will change from
case to case and is not dependent on the level of independence
d) Is not correct. Testing can be performed at different levels of
independence, ranging from no independence for the author to very
high independence for testers from outside the organization, with testers
from outside the developer’s team generally more independent than
testers from within the team. However, there is more reason to believe
that testers from outside the team are likely to be more isolated from the
developers and so are more likely to be blamed for delays in product
release

9 d a) Is not correct. Quality control applies to all development activities,
meaning that every software development activity has a corresponding
test activity. However, here we are attempting to equate test levels with
development levels, and, although we know what is meant by ‘test
levels’, there is no common understanding of the term ‘ development
level’
b) Is not correct. Every software development activity has a corresponding
test activity; however test objectives are quite different. For instance,
there might be a test objective of ensuring that a test object adheres to
a contractual requirement that a certain type of testing must be
performed before delivery. In this case there is no reason for there to be
a corresponding development objective
c) Is not correct. Quality control applies to all development activities,
meaning that every software development activity has a corresponding
test activity. However, the same symmetry does not apply to testing and
user activities. For instance, for some systems it is difficult to even
identify the end users. Also, some test activities are focused on
developers (e.g., testing for ease of maintainability), which has no user
aspect to it
d) Is correct. Quality control applies to all development activities, meaning
that every software development activity has a corresponding test

11 b a) Is not correct. Practices involved in shift left are aimed at implementing
more test activities in the early phases of the software development life
cycle (SDLC), portraying the SDLC as moving from left to right. There is
no such thing as the left-hand side of the test process
b) Is correct. Shift left emphasizes the importance of starting testing earlier
in the SDLC. Implementing shift left testing necessitates additional
training, and increased effort and costs during the early phases of the
SDLC, nevertheless, overall savings should be higher
c) Is not correct. Although automated component tests and component
integration tests for regression testing are generally valuable, the
creation of these tests is normally the responsibility of the developers,
and if a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) approach is
followed, then these tests will have been submitted with the code. In
some situations the tester may automate tests for regression testing,
and sometimes even for component tests and component integration
tests, however this is not part of shift left which moves testing earlier in
the SDLC
d) Is not correct. Training testers to perform tasks early in the SDLC would
support a shift left approach by emphasizing the importance of starting
testing earlier in the SDLC. However, automating more test activities to
be performed later in the SDLC is not part of shift-left

12 c a) Is not correct. One of the purposes of retrospectives is to identify
potential process improvements, which, if put into practice, should result
in the quality of future outputs of the development process (test objects)
being higher. So, this is likely to occur as a result of a retrospective
b) Is not correct. A benefit of retrospectives for testing includes increased
test efficiency through process improvements. So, this is likely to occur
as a result of a retrospective
c) Is correct. Participants at retrospectives typically include testers,
developers, architects, product owners, and business analysts, but end
users are rarely invited or attend these meetings – and they are also
unlikely to receive any reports from these meetings. So, it is very
unlikely that they will learn and understand more about the development
and test processes through retrospectives
d) Is not correct. A benefit of retrospectives for testing includes improved
quality of testware (including automated test scripts) through joint
reviews with developers. So, this is likely to occur as a result of a

15 d Considering each of the listed example defects:
i. Two different parts of the design specification disagree due to the
complexity of the design – this is an example of a specification
defect, which includes inconsistencies, ambiguities,
contradictions, omissions, inaccuracies, and duplications, which
can most easily be found by static testing
ii. A response time is too long and so makes users lose patience –
this is an example of a response time defect, which can only be
detected in practice by executing the program and measuring the
response time, which can most easily be found by dynamic
testing
iii. A path in the code cannot be reached during execution - this is an
example of a coding defect, which includes variables with
undefined values, undeclared variables, duplicated or
unreachable code, and excessive code complexity, which can
most easily be found by static testing
iv. A variable is declared but never subsequently used in the
program - this is an example of a coding defect, which includes
variables with undefined values, undeclared variables, duplicated
or unreachable code, and excessive code complexity, which can
most easily be found by static testing
v. The amount of memory needed by the program to generate a
report is too high – this is an example of a performance defect,
which can only be detected in practice by executing the program
and measuring the memory used, which can most easily be found
by dynamic testing
Thus:

1. Technical review - This type of review is performed by technically
qualified reviewers and led by a moderator. The objectives are to
gain consensus and make decisions on technical problems while
also evaluating quality and building confidence in the work
product, generating new ideas, motivating and enabling authors to
improve, and detecting anomalies
2. Informal review - The main objective is to detect anomalies. The
process is not defined and does not require formal documented
output
3. Inspection - This is the most formal review type, and it follows the
complete generic review process. The primary objective is to find
the most anomalies, and other objectives include evaluating
quality and building confidence in the work product, motivating
and enabling authors to improve, and collecting metrics that can
be used to enhance the software development lifecycle (SDLC),
including the inspection process. The author cannot act as the
review leader or scribe
4. Walkthrough - Led by the author, this type of review serves
various objectives such as evaluating quality and building
confidence in the work product, educating reviewers, gaining
consensus, generating new ideas, motivating and enabling
authors to improve, and detecting anomalies. Reviewers might
perform an individual review before the walkthrough, but this is
not mandatory
A. Includes objectives such as gaining consensus, generating new
ideas, and motivating authors to improve
B. Includes objectives such as educating reviewers, gaining
consensus, generating new ideas and detecting anomalies
C. The main objective is detecting anomalies and it requires metrics

b) Is not correct. Both black-box test techniques and experience-based

c) Is correct. Black-box test techniques (also known as specification-based
techniques) are based on an analysis of the specified behavior of the
test object without reference to its internal structure. So, the test basis is
usually a specification. Experience-based test techniques effectively use
the knowledge and experience of testers for the design and

designing tests, may not use the specification at all
d) Is not correct. Experience-based test techniques can detect defects that

21 d The equivalence partitions are: {…, 99, 100}, {101, 102, …, 198, 199}, {200,
201, …}.
Thus, there are 4 boundary values, which are: 100, 101, 199 and 200.
In 2-value BVA, for each boundary value there are two coverage items (the
boundary value and its closest neighbor belonging to the adjacent partition).
As the closest neighbors are also boundary values in the adjacent partition,
then there are just four coverage items.
Thus:
a) Is not correct. Only 100 and 200 are valid coverage items for 2-value
BVA, so we achieve 50% coverage
b) Is not correct. Only 100 and 200 are valid coverage items for 2-value
BVA, so we achieve 50% coverage
c) Is not correct. Only 100 and 101 are valid coverage items for 2-value

c) Is not correct. Both combinations (T, T, T) and (F, T, T) match only one

25 a a) Is correct. Performing only black-box testing does not provide a
measure of actual code coverage. White-box coverage measures
provide an objective measurement of coverage and provide the
necessary information to allow additional tests to be generated to
increase this coverage, and subsequently increase confidence in the
code
b) Is not correct. This statement is correct, but it has nothing to do with
black-box testing
c) Is not correct. In general there are no relationships between white-box
test techniques and black-box test techniques
d) Is not correct. White-box test techniques are used to design tests based
on the test object itself, while black-box test techniques are used to
design tests based on the specification. Therefore, there is no relation
between coverage items derived from these two types of test
techniques

26 b a) Is not correct. Exploratory testing uses test charters, not a list of
possible defects/failures. Although exploratory testing can incorporate
the use of other test techniques, in this case a fault attack is the most
likely option
b) Is correct. This is a list of possible failures. Fault attacks are a
methodical approach to the implementation of error guessing and
require the tester to create or acquire a list of possible errors, defects
and failures, and to design tests that will identify defects associated with
the errors, expose the defects, or cause the failures
c) Is not correct. The tester is using a checklist of items to support their
testing. Both error guessing and checklist-based testing use such lists,
however, the list here is of possible failures, not test conditions, and so
the MOST PROBABLE test technique is fault attack, which focuses on
errors, defects and failures
d) Is not correct. BVA is based on an analysis of boundary values of
equivalence partitions. The above list does not mention equivalence
partitions or their boundaries

27 d a) Is not correct. Although it is true that the tester can implement and
execute detailed test cases based on the checklist, it does not explain
how this would result in increased coverage
b) Is not correct. Checklist items should not be automated. But even if they
are, the automated test scripts always execute the tests in the same
way, which usually does not result in increased coverage
c) Is not correct. It is true that each checklist item should be tested
separately and independently. But this impacts the test execution order
and does not impact the achieved coverage, and so does not result in
increased coverage
d) Is correct. If the checklists are high-level, some variability in the actual
testing is likely to occur, resulting in potentially greater coverage but
less repeatability. If two testers follow a checklist of high-level items,
each of them may use different test data, test steps, etc. This way, one
tester will probably cover some areas not covered by the other tester
and this will result in increased coverage

data is part of the test cases, not the test plan. Also, it is usually
impossible to define such data when the test plan is created, because it

32 a We want to run test cases according to their priorities, but we also need to
consider the dependencies.
If we only consider priorities, we want to first run TC 5 and TC 7 (highest
priority), then TC 1, TC 3, and TC 4, and finally TC 2 and TC 6 (lowest
priority).
However, in order to run TC 7, we need to first run TC 4.
In order to run TC 5, we need to run TC 4 and TC 2, but TC 2 is blocked by
TC 1, which should be run prior to TC 2.
So, in order to run priority 1 test cases as early as possible, the first five test
cases should be: TC 4 - TC 7 - TC 1 - TC 2 - TC 5.
Next, we need to run TC 3, because it has higher priority than TC 6.
Thus the full schedule will be TC 4 – TC 7 – TC 1 – TC 2 – TC 5 – TC 3 –
TC 6.
So, the sixth test case will be TC 3.

40 d a) Is not correct. ‘The capability of generating test cases without access to

testers or tools requires access to the test basis
b) Is not correct. ‘The achievement of increased coverage through more
objective assessment’ is not a direct benefit of test automation. Test
automation will provide more objective assessment of coverage,
however that objective assessment will not increase the coverage. Only
by using the results of the coverage to write further test cases can the
coverage possibly be increased
c) Is not correct. ‘The increase in test execution times available with higher
processing power’ is a contradictory statement as higher processing
power would normally reduce execution times, and increased execution
times are not a benefit as the testing would take longer
d) Is correct. The prevention of human errors through greater consistency
and repeatability is a benefit of test automation as test automation
cannot suffer from human errors. For instance, it means that tests are
consistently derived from requirements, test data is created in a
systematic manner, and tests are executed by a tool in the same order

Select ONE Option.
Question #11 (3 Points)
You are system-testing a mobile banking application. The development is divided between a backend
team that designs the business logic on the servers and a frontend team that designs the graphical user
interface (GUI) and the application on the mobile devices. The backend team is experienced and can
debug and resolve defects quickly and reliably. The frontend team has undergone a lot of staff turnover.
Recently, critical failures occurred in production and were resolved in the previous release:
• Payments rejected by the destination banks due to invalid bank account numbers. The root cause
was insufficient validation of bank accounts in the mobile devices.
• Incorrectly displayed GUI elements on some screen sizes and resolutions that obstructed users
when entering payments.
The next release will contain the following changes:
• A new feature was added that allows users to make payments by taking a photo of an invoice with
their mobile device.
• A major defect in the calculation of the account balance was fixed.
• The navigation bar in the GUI was redesigned to comply with accessibility standards.
You have a comprehensive regression test suite with tests categorized by the impact of potential failures.
Due to limited testing resources, you cannot execute them all, so you chose the history-based regression
testing strategy. Which of the following test objectives suits this scenario THE BEST?
a) Execute all regression tests for the bank account validation using both photo-based and manually
entered invoice payments
b) Execute all regression tests for the settlement of payments and other features related to balance
calculations
c) Execute all regression tests with a critical or major risk impact of potential failures
d) Execute the regression tests of the GUI containing the navigation bar on mobile devices with various
displays, prioritized by the device distribution statistics

Question #25 (2 Points)
A route planning system calculates the optimal route for a car trip. You test the system, using an API
function that has three input parameters: starting point coordinates X, destination point coordinates Y,
and optimization criterion O. Criterion O can take one of two values: S (search for the shortest route) or
T (search for the route with the fastest travel time). The function returns the length of the optimal route in
kilometers.
You test the correctness of the system using metamorphic testing with the following metamorphic
relations:
• MR1: If the criterion changes from S to T, and X and Y remain unchanged, the calculated distance
cannot decrease.
• MR2: For the criterion S, the sum of the lengths of routes from X to Y and from Y to Z cannot be
lower than the length of the route from X to Z.
Suppose Rome, Pisa, and Milan are the coordinates of three points on the map. The two source test
cases are as follows:
• TC1. Input: X = Rome, Y = Pisa, O = S. Output: 335 km.
• TC2. Input: X = Pisa, Y = Milan, O = S. Output: 282 km.
Which of the following follow-up test cases causes a failure by violating at least one of the metamorphic
relations MR1 or MR2?
a) Input: X = Rome, Y = Rome, O = S. Output: 335 km
b) Input: X = Pisa, Y = Milan, O = T. Output: 282 km
c) Input: X = Milan, Y = Pisa, O = S. Output: 283 km
d) Input: X = Rome, Y = Milan, O = S. Output: 630 km

• Req236: The coin controller changes its mode to sufficient as soon as the user inserts enough
coins.
• Req237: The user shall be able to cancel the transaction before beverage delivery and get the
inserted coins returned. The coin controller will be empty after cancel is selected.
• Req243: The coin controller shall display an appropriate message when the user has inserted
enough coins for payment and sum up any further coins inserted.
• Req253: When the user inserts a coin with which the required amount is not reached, the coin
controller shall remain in the partially inserted mode and add the value of the inserted coin to the
intermediate value paid.
• Req267: If the coin controller is in sufficient mode and the user triggers the delivery, it shall deliver
the beverage to the user.

Question #44 (3 Points)
A home security system architecture comprises four components: a control panel, a user interface, a
cloud-based backend system, and an event processing engine.
In similar projects within your organization, a strong correlation was observed between the size of the
components and the number of defects found in component testing. On average, one defect was found
per 50 lines of code. You use this model to predict the number of defects in each component.
The test results for the individual system components, containing the actual number of defects, are as
follows:
Component Lines of code Defects found
Control panel 600 14
User interface 2000 45
Backend system 400 17
Event processing engine 500 8

b) User interface
c) Backend system
d) Event processing engine
Select ONE Option.
Question #45 (1 Point)
How does defect classification support root cause analysis (RCA)?
a) It allows RCA to be carried out early, before static testing and dynamic testing, because RCA may be
based on abstract categories of defects rather than on specific individual defects
b) It allows RCA to be combined with test techniques because defect classification uses the same
software development lifecycle models as test techniques
c) It makes RCA more efficient because the analysis focuses not on individual defects but on groups of
defects with similar characteristics
d) It makes RCA more effective because defect classification allows for a deeper analysis of defects and
the discovery of more root causes

version of the test object should be defined to support future maintenance.
b) The test cases should contain the concrete values of the test data required for preconditions, inputs,
and outputs to enable test execution.
c) If the test basis uses a glossary of functional terms, the test cases should also use that terminology to
make them consistent and understandable.
d) Test cases based on end-to-end scenarios should be limited to a few steps of the scenarios to ease
their combination into test procedures and an analysis of the cause of failures.
Select ONE Option.

1 The user selects the item with multiple versions IMS1 shows the details of the latest version in
edit mode
2 The user selects an older version of the item IMS1 shows the details of that version in view-
only mode
You have specified the following keywords:
1. Search the database for an item with multiple versions (Item-ID)
2. Select item (Item-ID)
3. Select item version (Number)
4. Assert details displayed are correct (Screen, Item-ID, Number)
5. Assert details are editable (Screen)
6. Assert details are non-editable (Screen)
You want to use keywords in one of the following groups of elements of the high-level test cases:
A) Precondition only
B) Step 1 only
C) Step 2 only
D) Both step 1 and step 2
Assign each specified keyword (1-6) to ONE group of test case elements (A-D) while not leaving any
group empty.

Question #A6 (2 Points)
Standard letters carried by a postage service have a maximum length of 235mm and a maximum weight
of 20g. You are testing an automatic letter scanning system that can measure with a precision of 1 mm
and 1g respectively.
You perform domain testing for valid standard letter sizes with the following inputs:
No. Length in mm Weight in g
X1 160 15
X2 200 25
X3 230 21
X4 235 20
X5 250 16
X6 236 18
Inputs can have of one of the coverage item types:
1. ON point for both length and weight
2. IN point for both length and weight
3. OFF point for length only
4. OFF point for weight only
5. OUT point for length only
6. OUT point for weight only
Assign each input (X1-X6) to EXACTLY ONE coverage item type (1-6).
